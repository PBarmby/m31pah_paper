	Abstract = {We confirm our earlier tentative detection of M31* in X-rays and measure its light curve and spectrum. Observations in 2004-2005 find M31* rather quiescent in the X-ray and radio. However, X-ray observations in 2006-2007 show M31* to be highly variable at times. A separate variable X-ray source is found near P1, the brighter of the two optical nuclei. The apparent angular Bondi radius of M31* is the largest of any black hole and large enough to be well resolved with Chandra. The diffuse emission within this Bondi radius is found to have an X-ray temperature ~0.3 keV and density 0.1 cm-3, indistinguishable from the hot gas in the surrounding regions of the bulge given the statistics allowed by the current observations. The X-ray source at the location of M31* is consistent with a point source and a power-law spectrum with energy slope 0.9 $\pm$ 0.2. Our identification of this X-ray source with M31* is based solely on positional coincidence.},

	Abstract = {We present an analysis of the host properties of 85 224 emission-line galaxies selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We show that Seyferts and low-ionization narrow emission-line regions (LINERs) form clearly separated branches on the standard optical diagnostic diagrams. We derive a new empirical classification scheme which cleanly separates star-forming galaxies, composite active galactic nucleus-HII (AGN-HII) galaxies, Seyferts and LINERs and we study the host galaxy properties of these different classes of objects. LINERs are older, more massive, less dusty, less concentrated, and they have higher velocity dispersions and lower [OIII] luminosities than Seyfert galaxies have. Seyferts and LINERs are most strongly distinguished by their [OIII] luminosities. We then consider the quantity L[OIII]/sigma4, which is an indicator of the black hole accretion rate relative to the Eddington rate. Remarkably, we find that at fixed L[OIII]/sigma4, all differences between Seyfert and LINER host properties disappear. LINERs and Seyferts form a continuous sequence, with LINERs dominant at low L/LEDD and Seyferts dominant at high L/LEDD. These results suggest that the majority of LINERs are AGN and that the Seyfert/LINER dichotomy is analogous to the high/low-state models and show that pure LINERs require a harder ionizing radiation field with lower ionization parameter than required by Seyfert galaxies, consistent with the low and high X-ray binary states.},

	Abstract = {We present high-resolution mid-infrared (MIR) imaging, nuclear spectral energy distributions (SEDs), and archival Spitzer spectra for 22 low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs; L bol <~ 1042 erg s-1). Infrared (IR) observations may advance our understanding of the accretion flows in LLAGNs, the fate of the obscuring torus at low accretion rates, and, perhaps, the star formation histories of these objects. However, while comprehensively studied in higher-luminosity Seyferts and quasars, the nuclear IR properties of LLAGNs have not yet been well determined. We separate the present LLAGN sample into three categories depending on their Eddington ratio and radio emission, finding different IR characteristics for each class. (1) At the low-luminosity, low-Eddington-ratio (log L bol/L Edd < -4.6) end of the sample, we identify "host-dominated" galaxies with strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon bands that may indicate active (circum-)nuclear star formation. (2) Some very radio-loud objects are also present at these low Eddington ratios. The IR emission in these nuclei is dominated by synchrotron radiation, and some are likely to be unobscured type 2 AGNs that genuinely lack a broad-line region. (3) At higher Eddington ratios, strong, compact nuclear sources are visible in the MIR images. The nuclear SEDs of these galaxies are diverse; some resemble typical Seyfert nuclei, while others lack a well-defined MIR "dust bump." Strong silicate emission is present in many of these objects. We speculate that this, together with high ratios of silicate strength to hydrogen column density, could suggest optically thin dust and low dust-to-gas ratios, in accordance with model predictions that LLAGNs do not host a Seyfert-like obscuring torus. We anticipate that detailed modeling of the new data and SEDs in terms of accretion disk, jet, radiatively inefficient accretion flow, and torus components will provide further insights into the nuclear structures and processes of LLAGNs.},

	Abstract = {We report the first detection of ~10 and ~18 mum silicate dust emissions in a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN), obtained in Spitzer IRS 7-37 mum spectroscopy of the type 1 LINER galaxy NGC 3998. Silicate emissions in AGNs have only recently been detected in several quasars. Our detection counters suggestions that silicate emissions are present only in the most luminous AGNs. The silicate features may be signatures of a dusty ``obscuring torus'' viewed face-on as postulated for type 1 AGNs. However, the apparently cool (~200 K) dust is inconsistent with theoretical expectations of much hotter torus walls. Furthermore, not all type 1 objects are silicate emission sources. Alternatively, the silicate emission may originate in dust not directly associated with a torus. We find that the long-wavelength (>~20 mum) tail of the emission in NGC 3998 is significantly weaker than in the sample of bright QSOs recently presented by Hao et al. The 10 mum profile in our NGC 3998 spectrum is inconsistent with ``standard'' silicate ISM dust. This may indicate differences in the dust composition, grain size distribution, or degree of crystallization. The differences between NGC 3998, QSOs, and Galactic templates suggest that there are significant environmental variations.},

@article{AGNtypes1995,
	Abstract = {We use a modified version of the code of Efstathiou & Rowan-Robinson, which solves accurately the axially symmetric radiative-transfer problem in dust clouds, to model the infrared emission from dust in active galactic nuclei. The method takes into account a distribution of grain species and sizes, and includes treatment of multiple scattering from grains. We consider three different geometries (flared discs, tapered discs and anisotropic spheres) for the torus that is believed to obscure the central engine and broad-line region, and compare predicted spectra with the observations. We find that very thick tapered discs (discs whose height increases with distance from the central source, but tapers off to a constant height in their outer part) with an opening angle of ~=45 deg and following an r^-1 density distribution are the most successful in satisfying the observational constraints. Tapered discs with different parameters, as well as flared discs and anisotropic spheres, predict spectra that are inconsistent with the presently available data, either because they exhibit strong emission or absorption 10-mu features when viewed face-on, or because they predict too narrow an infrared continuum. Because of the geometry and the density distribution we assumed for the tapered discs, the 10-mum emission features are eliminated with a relatively low equatorial optical depth. The resulting spectra are therefore much broader than those predicted by the very thick and compact cylinders of uniform density suggested by Pier & Krolik. We also see no need to invoke lower silicate efficiencies or silicate depletion by shocks.},

	Abstract = {The unified model of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) predicts silicate emission features at 10 and 18 mum in type 1 AGNs, and such features have now been observed in objects ranging from distant quasi-stellar objects to nearby LINERs. More surprising, however, is the detection of silicate emission in a few type 2 AGNs. By combining Gemini and Spitzer mid-infrared imaging and spectroscopy of NGC 2110, the closest known Seyfert 2 galaxy with silicate emission features, we can constrain the location of the silicate-emitting region to within 32 pc of the nucleus. This is the strongest constraint yet on the size of the silicate-emitting region in a Seyfert galaxy of any type. While this result is consistent with a narrow-line region origin for the emission, comparison with clumpy torus models demonstrates that emission from an edge-on torus can also explain the silicate emission features and 2-20 mum spectral energy distribution of this object. In many of the best-fitting models the torus has only a small number of clouds along the line of sight, and does not extend far above the equatorial plane. Extended silicate-emitting regions may well be present in AGNs, but this work establishes that emission from the torus itself is also a viable option for the origin of silicate emission features in active galaxies of both type 1 and type 2.},

	Abstract = {Mid-infrared observations of the Andromeda galaxy, M31, obtained with the Infrared Array Camera on board the Spitzer Space Telescope are presented. The image mosaics cover areas of approximately 3.7d×1.6d and include the satellite galaxies M32 and NGC 205. The appearance of M31 varies dramatically in the different mid-infrared bands, from the smooth bulge and disk of the old stellar population seen at 3.6 mum to the well-known ``10 kpc ring'' dominating the 8 mum image. The similarity of the 3.6 mum and optical isophotes and the nearly constant optical-mid-infrared color over the inner 400" confirm that there is no significant extinction at optical wavelengths in M31's bulge. The nuclear colors indicate the presence of dust but not an infrared-bright active galactic nucleus. The integrated 8 mum nonstellar luminosity implies a star formation rate of 0.4 Msolar yr-1, consistent with other indicators that show M31 to be a quiescent galaxy.},

The IRS comprises four separate spectrograph modules covering the wavelength range from 5.3 to 38 mum with spectral resolutions, R=lambda/Deltalambda~90 and 600, and it was optimized to take full advantage of the very low background in the space environment. The IRS is performing at or better than the prelaunch predictions. An autonomous target acquisition capability enables the IRS to locate the mid-infrared centroid of a source, providing the information so that the spacecraft can accurately offset that centroid to a selected slit. This feature is particularly useful when taking spectra of sources with poorly known coordinates. An automated data-reduction pipeline has been developed at the Spitzer Science Center.  The IRS was a collaborative venture between Cornell University and Ball Aerospace Corporation funded by NASA through the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Ames Research Center.},

@article{Kormendy:1999lr,
	Abstract = {New spectroscopy of M31 supports Tremaine's model in which both nuclei are parts of a single eccentric disk of stars orbiting the black hole (BH). The kinematics and Hubble Space Telescope photometry are used to measure the offset of the BH from the center of mass. This confirms that the BH mass is ~3x10^7 M_solar by a technique that is nearly independent of stellar-dynamical models. We present spectroscopy of the nucleus of M31 obtained with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and Subarcsecond Imaging Spectrograph. Spectra at the Ca infrared triplet lines (seeing sigma_*=0.27") are used to measure the stellar kinematics, and spectra at the Mg I b lines (sigma_*=0.31") are used to measure metallicities. We also measure nonparametric line-of-sight velocity distributions (LOSVDs). All spectra confirm the steep rotation and velocity dispersion gradients that imply that M31 contains a 3.3x10^7 M_solar central dark object. At sigma_*=0.27", the maximum bulge-subtracted rotation velocity of the nucleus is 233+/-4 km s^-1 on the P2 side, and the maximum velocity dispersion is 287+/-9 km s^-1. The dispersion peak is displaced by 0.20"+/-0.03" from the velocity center in the direction opposite to P1, confirming a result by Bacon and coworkers. The higher surface brightness nucleus, P1, is colder than the bulge, with sigma~=100 km s^-1 at r~=1^''. Cold light from P1 contributes at the velocity center; this explains part of the sigma(r) asymmetry. The nucleus is cold at r>~1^'' on both sides of the center. Our results are used to test Tremaine's model in which the double nucleus is a single eccentric disk of stars orbiting the BH. (1) The model predicts that the velocity center of the nucleus is displaced by 0.2" from P2 toward P1. Our observations show a displacement of 0.08"+/-0.01" before bulge subtraction and 0.10"+/-0.01" after bulge subtraction. (2) The model predicts a minimum sigma~=135 km s^-1 at P1. We observe sigma=123+/-2 km s^-1. Observations (1) and (2) may be reconciled with the model if its parameters are tweaked so that the orbital eccentricity is made larger and the orientation of the orbits is made to point more nearly at us. (3) The model rotation curve is asymmetric; at perfect resolution, V is 60 km s^-1 higher on the P2 side than on the P1 side. At sigma_*=0.27", we observe an asymmetry of 54+/-4 km s^-1 after bulge subtraction. We regard this as confirmation of the model's essential idea that stellar orbits are eccentric and coherently aligned. (4) The model predicts that P1 and P2 should have the same stellar population. We confirm this: P1 is more similar to P2 than it is to the bulge or to a globular cluster or to M32. This makes it unlikely that P1 consists of accreted stars. (5) Our observation that there is cold light on both sides of the center implies, if the nucleus is an eccentric disk, that some stars have escaped from the P1-P2 alignment and have phase-mixed around the galaxy's center. The dispersion peak coincides with a cluster of ultraviolet-bright stars seen in Hubble Space Telescope images. We propose that the BH is in this cluster. Its center is displaced by 0.068"+/-0.010" from the bulge center. If we put a 3.3x10^7 M_solar dark object in the UV cluster and adopt the dynamically determined mass-to-light ratio of the stars, then the center of mass (COM) of the bulge, nucleus, and dark object coincides with the bulge center to within 0.017"+/-0.016". The COM also agrees with the velocity center of the bulge and outer nucleus. Therefore, the asymmetry of the stars in the double nucleus supports our suggestion that the BH is in the UV cluster. If the stars have a normal mass-to-light ratio, then the location of the COM also confirms the mass of the BH, largely independent of dynamical models. Tremaine's model implies that any dark cluster alternative to a BH is less than 0.13"+/-0.03"=0.49 pc in radius. The observed mass-to-light ratio is M/L_V~=300 in a cylinder of radius r=0.13" and M/L_V~=2200 in a sphere of radius r=0.13". This is much larger than previous measurements of M/L_V. This result and the COM argument greatly strengthen the detection of a central dark object in M31.},

	Abstract = {In 0.5 arcsec seeing, the 2.2 micron light distribution in the nucleus of M31 resembles the optical light distribution. The asymmetry seen in the optical data, a positive skew on the SW major axis, is also seen in the IR. It follows that the asymmetry is not an artifact of selective foreground extinction by dust. Either the asymmetry exists in the distribution of stars, or it is produced by a dust disk which is optically thick at 2.2 microns and lies within the nucleus, perpendicular to the outer disk of M31. An upper limit of 0.3 mag is put on any V - K excess in the central arcsecond of M31. This is sufficient to exclude a cluster of low-mass stars as the source of the high mass-to-light ratio in the nucleus, for any stellar mass exceeding the main-sequence hydrogen burning limit.},

	Abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the radial distribution of dust properties in the SINGS sample, performed on a set of ultraviolet (UV), infrared (IR), and H I surface brightness profiles, combined with published molecular gas profiles and metallicity gradients. The internal extinction, derived from the total-IR (TIR)-to-far-UV (FUV) luminosity ratio, decreases with radius, and is larger in Sb-Sbc galaxies. The TIR-to-FUV ratio correlates with the UV spectral slope beta, following a sequence shifted to redder UV colors with respect to that of starbursts. The star formation history (SFH) is identified as the main driver of this departure. Both L TIR/L FUV and beta correlate well with metallicity, especially in moderately face-on galaxies. The relation shifts to redder colors with increased scatter in more edge-on objects. By applying physical dust models to our radial spectral energy distributions, we have derived radial profiles of the total dust mass surface density, the fraction of the total dust mass contributed by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and the intensity of the radiation field heating the grains. The dust profiles are exponential, their radial scale length being constant from Sb to Sd galaxies (only ~10% larger than the stellar scale length). Many S0/a-Sab galaxies have central depressions in their dust radial distributions. The PAH abundance increases with metallicity for 12 + log(O/H) < 9, and at larger metallicities the trend flattens and even reverses, with the SFH being a plausible underlying driver for this behavior. The dust-to-gas ratio is also well correlated with metallicity and therefore decreases with galactocentric radius. Although most of the total emitted IR power (especially in the outer regions of disks) is contributed by dust grains heated by diffuse starlight with a similar intensity as the local Milky Way radiation field, a small amount of the dust mass (~1%) is required to be exposed to very intense starlight in order to reproduce the observed fluxes at 24 mum, accounting for ~10% of the total integrated IR power.},

@article{Kennicutt:2003lr,
	Abstract = {We use high signal-to-noise ratio spectra of 20 H II regions in the giant spiral galaxy M101 to derive electron temperatures for the H II regions and robust metal abundances over radii R=0.19-1.25R0 (6-41 kpc). We compare the consistency of electron temperatures measured from the [O III] lambda4363, [N II] lambda5755, [S III] lambda6312, and [O II] lambda7325 auroral lines. Temperatures from [O III], [S III], and [N II] are correlated with relative offsets that are consistent with expectations from nebular photoionization models. However, the temperatures derived from the [O II] lambda7325 line show a large scatter and are nearly uncorrelated with temperatures derived from other ions. We tentatively attribute this result to observational and physical effects, which may introduce large random and systematic errors into abundances derived solely from [O II] temperatures. Our derived oxygen abundances are well fitted by an exponential distribution over six disk scale lengths, from approximately 1.3 (O/H)solar in the center to 1/15 (O/H)solar in the outermost region studied [for solar 12+log(O/H)=8.7]. We measure significant radial gradients in N/O and He/H abundance ratios, but relatively constant S/O and Ar/O. Our results are in approximate agreement with previously published abundances studies of M101 based on temperature measurements of a few H II regions. However, our abundances are systematically lower by 0.2-0.5 dex than those derived from the most widely used strong-line ``empirical'' abundance indicators, again consistent with previous studies based on smaller H II region samples. Independent measurements of the Galactic interstellar oxygen abundance from ultraviolet absorption lines are in good agreement with the Te-based nebular abundances. We suspect that most of the disagreement with the strong-line abundances arises from uncertainties in the nebular models that are used to calibrate the ``empirical'' scale, and that strong-line abundances derived for H II regions and emission-line galaxies are as much as a factor of 2 higher than the actual oxygen abundances. However, other explanations, such as the effects of temperature fluctuations on the auroral line based abundances, cannot be completely ruled out. These results point to the need for direct abundance determinations of a larger sample of extragalactic H II regions, especially for objects more metal-rich than solar.},

	Abstract = {Low-resolution, mid-infrared Spitzer/IRS spectral maps are presented for three nearby, low-metallicity dwarf galaxies (NGC 55, NGC 3109, and IC 5152) for the purpose of examining the spatial distribution and variation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission. The sample straddles a metallicity of 12 + log(O/H) ≈ 8, a transition point below which PAH intensity empirically drops and the character of the interstellar medium changes. We derive quantitative radiances of PAH features and atomic lines on both global and spatially resolved scales. The Spitzer spectra, combined with extensive ancillary data from the UV through the mid-infrared, allow us to examine changes in the physical environments and in PAH feature radiances down to a physical scale of ~50 pc. We discuss correlations between various PAH emission feature and atomic line radiances. The (6.2 mum)/(11.3 mum), (7.7 mum)/(11.3 mum), (8.6 mum)/(11.3 mum), (7.7 mum)/(6.2 mum), and (8.6 mum)/(6.2 mum) PAH radiance ratios are found to be independent of position across all three galaxies, although the ratios do vary from galaxy to galaxy. As seen in other galaxies, we find no variation in the grain size distribution as a function of local radiation field strength. Absolute PAH feature intensities as measured by a ratio of PAH/(24 mum) radiances are seen to vary both positionally within a given galaxy and from one galaxy to another when integrated over the full observed extent of each system. We examine direct comparisons of CC mode PAH ratios (7.7 mum)/(6.2 mum) and (8.6 mum)/(6.2 mum) to the mixed (CC/CH) mode PAH ratio (7.7 mum)/(11.3 mum). We find little variation in either mode and no difference in trends between modes. While the local conditions change markedly over the observed regions of these galaxies, the properties of PAH emission show a remarkable degree of uniformity.},

	Abstract = {The behavior of the aromatic features as a function of metallicity/radiation field hardness in M101 HII regions and starburst galaxies is investigated using Spitzer/IRS spectra. These spectra reveal that the 6.2, 7.8+8.6, and 11.3 micron aromatics have different dependencies on metallicity/radiation field hardness. Specifically, the 6.2 and 7.8+8.6 micron aromatics are weak or absent at a metallicity, 12+log(O/H), of approx. 8.0 while the 11.3 micron feature remains relatively strong. These results apply to both the M101 HII regions and starbursts showing that HII regions can indeed be thought of as ``mini-starbursts.'' Comparison of this work with various candidate materials results in a good match with the annealing behavior in Quenched Carbonaceous Composite (QCC) which is an amorphous, hydrogenated, carbonaceous solid.},

	Abstract = {Cosmological simulations of galaxy formation appear to show a "two-phase" character with a rapid early phase at z >~ 2 during which "in situ" stars are formed within the galaxy from infalling cold gas followed by an extended phase since z <~ 3 during which "ex situ" stars are primarily accreted. In the latter phase, massive systems grow considerably in mass and radius by accretion of smaller satellite stellar systems formed at quite early times (z>3) outside of the virial radius of the forming central galaxy. These tentative conclusions are obtained from high-resolution re-simulations of 39 individual galaxies in a full cosmological context with present-day virial halo masses ranging from 7 × 1011 M sun h -1 lsimM vir <~ 2.7 × 1013 M sun h -1 (h = 0.72) and central galaxy masses between 4.5 × 1010 M sun h -1 <~ M * <~ 3.6 × 1011 M sun h -1. The simulations include the effects of a uniform UV background, radiative cooling, star formation, and energetic feedback from Type II supernova. The importance of stellar accretion increases with galaxy mass and toward lower redshift. In our simulations, lower mass galaxies (M * <~ 9 × 1010 M sun h -1) accrete about 60% of their present-day stellar mass. High-mass galaxy (M * >~ 1.7 × 1011 M sun h -1) assembly is dominated by accretion and merging with about 80% of the stars added by the present day. In general the simulated galaxies approximately double their mass since z = 1. For massive systems this mass growth is not accompanied by significant star formation. The majority of the in situ created stars are formed at z>2, primarily out of cold gas flows. We recover the observational result of "archaeological downsizing," where the most massive galaxies harbor the oldest stars. We find that this is not in contradiction with hierarchical structure formation. Most stars in the massive galaxies are formed early on in smaller structures; the galaxies themselves are assembled late.},

	Abstract = {Three-dimensional spectroscopy of extended sources is typically performed with dedicated integral field spectrographs. We describe a method of reconstructing full spectral cubes, with two spatial and one spectral dimension, from rastered spectral mapping observations employing a single slit in a traditional slit spectrograph. When the background and image characteristics are stable, as is often achieved in space, the use of traditional long slits for integral field spectroscopy can substantially reduce instrument complexity over dedicated integral field designs, without loss of mapping efficiency-particularly compelling when a long-slit mode for single unresolved source follow-up is separately required. We detail a custom flux-conserving cube reconstruction algorithm, discuss issues of extended-source flux calibration, and describe CUBISM, a tool that implements these methods for spectral maps obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope's Infrared Spectrograph.},

	Abstract = {We present a sample of low-resolution 5-38 mum Spitzer IRS spectra of the inner few square kiloparsecs of 59 nearby galaxies spanning a large range of star formation properties. A robust method for decomposing mid-infrared galaxy spectra is described and used to explore the behavior of PAH emission and the prevalence of silicate dust extinction. Evidence for silicate extinction is found in ~1/8 of the sample, at strengths that indicate that most normal galaxies undergo AV<~3 mag averaged over their centers. The contribution of PAH emission to the total infrared power is found to peak near 10% and extend up to ~20% and is suppressed at metallicities Z<~Zsolar/4, as well as in low-luminosity AGN environments. Strong interband PAH feature strength variations (2-5 times) are observed, with the presence of a weak AGN and, to a lesser degree, increasing metallicity shifting power to the longer wavelength bands. A peculiar PAH emission spectrum with markedly diminished 5-8 mum features arises among the sample solely in systems with relatively hard radiation fields harboring low-luminosity AGNs. The AGNs may modify the emitting grain distribution and provide the direct excitation source of the unusual PAH emission, which cautions against using absolute PAH strength to estimate star formation rates in systems harboring active nuclei. Alternatively, the low star formation intensity often associated with weak AGNs may affect the spectrum. The effect of variations in the mid-infrared spectrum on broadband infrared surveys is modeled and points to more than a factor of 2 uncertainty in results that assume a fixed PAH emission spectrum, for redshifts z=0-2.5.},

@article{Sandstrom:2012lr,
	Abstract = {We present results of mid-infrared spectroscopic mapping observations of six star-forming regions in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) from the Spitzer Spectroscopic Survey of the SMC (S4MC). We detect the mid-IR emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in all of the mapped regions, greatly increasing the range of environments where PAHs have been spectroscopically detected in the SMC. We investigate the variations of the mid-IR bands in each region and compare our results to studies of the PAH bands in the SINGS sample and in a sample of low-metallicity starburst galaxies. PAH emission in the SMC is characterized by low ratios of the 6-9 mum features relative to the 11.3 mum feature and weak 8.6 and 17.0 mum features. Interpreting these band ratios in the light of laboratory and theoretical studies, we find that PAHs in the SMC tend to be smaller and less ionized than those in higher metallicity galaxies. Based on studies of PAH destruction, we argue that a size distribution shifted toward smaller PAHs cannot be the result of processing in the interstellar medium, but instead reflects differences in the formation of PAHs at low metallicity. Finally, we discuss the implications of our observations for our understanding of the PAH life-cycle in low-metallicity galaxies---namely that the observed deficit of PAHs may be a consequence of PAHs forming with smaller average sizes and therefore being more susceptible to destruction under typical interstellar medium conditions.},

@article{Gordon:2008lr,
	Abstract = {The aromatic features in M101 were studied spectroscopically and photometrically using observations from all three instruments on the Spitzer Space Telescope. The global SED of M101 shows strong aromatic feature (commonly called PAH feature) emission. The spatially resolved spectral and photometric measurements of the aromatic feature emission show strong variations with significantly weaker emission at larger radii. We compare these variations with changes in the ionization index (as measured by [Ne III]/[Ne II] and [S IV/S III], which range from 0.03 to 20 and 0.044 to 15, respectively) and metallicity [expressed as log(O/H)+12, which ranges from 8.1 to 8.8]. Over these ranges, the spectroscopic equivalent widths of the aromatic features from seven H II regions and the nucleus were found to correlate better with ionization index than metallicity. This implies that the weakening of the aromatic emission in massive star-forming regions is due primarily to processing of the dust grains in these environments, not to differences in how they form. The behavior of the aromatic feature versus ionization index correlation can be described as a constant equivalent width until a threshold in ionization index is reached ([Ne III]/[Ne II]~1), above which the equivalent widths decrease with a power-law dependence. This behavior is also seen for the starburst galaxy sample presented in the companion study by Engelbracht and coworkers, which expands the range of [Ne III]/[Ne II] ratios to 0.03-25 and log(O/H)+12 values to 7.1-8.8. The form of the correlation explains seemingly contradictory results present in the literature. The behavior of the ratios of different aromatic features versus ionization index does not follow the predictions of existing PAH models of the aromatic features, implying a more complex origin of the aromatic emission in massive star-forming regions.},
