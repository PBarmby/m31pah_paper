\begin{abstract}
We present {\sl Spitzer}/Infrared Spectrograph 5--21~$\mu$m spectroscopic maps towards 12 regions in the Andromeda galaxy (M31). 
These regions include the nucleus, bulge, an active region in the star-forming ring, and 9 other regions chosen to cover a range of mid-to-far-infrared colours. 
PAH feature ratios (6.2~$\mu$m and 7.7~$\mu$m features compared to the 11.3~$\mu$m feature) 
measured from our extracted M31 spectra are consistent with these seen in other nearby galaxies. 
Our  observations did not recover the unusual PAH ratios (suppressed 6--8~$\mu$m features and an enhanced 11.3~$\mu$m feature) seen in 
spectro-imaging observations with the ISOCAM instrument on the Infrared Space Observatory. 
The equivalent widths of the main PAH 
features decrease with increasing radiation hardness, consistent with that observed for other nearby spiral and starburst galaxies. 
The nucleus does not show any PAH emission except for the 11.3~$\mu$m feature, but does show strong silicate emission at 9.7~$\mu$m. 
Both of these characteristics provide evidence for a low luminosity active galactic nucleus in M31.
