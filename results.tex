%The first half of the paper can be significantly reduced. The main result of the analysis has basically been obtained with figure 9. The further analysis that leads to figures 10-12 is rather inconclusive. Some points match, some points do not and the authors claim they are not inconsistent with the published trends. This whole part of the paper could be summarised as follows:
%
%We have also examined the strength of the PAH emission bands -- EQW_8 vs RHI and the EQW of 7.7 and 11.2 vs RHI and metallicity -- with published values (refs). Within the uncertainties and given the limited number of regions we study, we conclude that the EQWs of the regions in M31 are consistent with previously published ``normal'' values.


\subsection{PAH band ratios}
\label{sect:pah_ratios}

Both the 6.2 and 7.7~$\mu$m features are thought to be coming from ionized PAHs and the 11.3~$\mu$m feature from neutral PAHs. Therefore we expect to see a correlation between the intensities of 6.2 and 7.7~$\mu$m PAH features normalized by the 11.3~$\mu$m feature.  Figure \ref{PAHlines}  compares the PAH flux ratios of 7.7/11.3  and 6.2/11.3 features. The figure shows a good correlation between these two PAH line ratios, consistent with that of the SINGS sample shown by \citet{Smith:2007lr}.
A similar correlation was also reported by  \citet{Galliano2008} for a sample of galaxies and a handful of extended H{\sc ii} regions
and by \citet{Vermeij2002} for Galactic and Magellanic Cloud H{\sc ii}regions. This provides evidence that the PAH emission from M31 is not unusual.

% REF:
%Sect 4.2 and 4.3
%If I understood the procedure in 4.2+3 leading to fig 10-12 well, these are done with normalised EQW. In Gordon et al 2008 this is done to be able to show that the spatial trend of the various bands in M101 is very similar if you forget about the absolute scale of each aromatic feature.
%
%However, for the interpretation of the data in fig 10-12 the absolute scale should not be removed. In doing this normalisation you have forced the mean Y-value of the blue and the open symbols to be 1 (log=0) and so it is unsurprising that these two samples clutter the same part of the diagram. I do not think one can conclude from this that similar PAH emission strengths are seen in M31 as in those other regions. Of course, it can still be that they also match in absolute value but it has not yet been demonstrated in the current manuscript.


\subsection{PAH equivalent widths versus radiation hardness and metallicity}
\label{sect:eqw_rh}

% needs to be rewritten
As mentioned in the introduction, PAH equivalent widths tend to decrease as radiation hardness increases,
and as metallicity decreases \citep{Calzetti:2010fk}.  This has been observed amongst different galaxies \citep{Engelbracht_2008} 
as well as within a single galaxy \citep{Gordon:2008lr}. 
The equivalent widths of the M31 PAH features are compared with RHI in Figures~\ref{englII} and \ref{gordII}.
For reference, we also show the starburst sample of \citet{Engelbracht_2008} 
and the seven H~{\sc ii} regions in M101 observed by \citet{Gordon:2008lr}.
To make a direct comparison with the M101 sample, we normalized the M31 EQWs in Figure~\ref{gordII} using the same procedure
as \citet{Gordon:2008lr}, dividing each EQW by the  weighted average over all regions in the respective samples. 
The equivalent widths seem to be decreasing with increasing radiation hardness, consistent with previous results. 
This also helps to confirm that the PAH emission in M31 is not unusual.

Figure \ref{metalicityVseqw} shows the normalized EQWs of the PAH features  versus the metallicity for our sample and the starburst 
galaxies of \citet{Engelbracht_2008}. 
 It is well known that there are systematic offsets between different 
 methods used to measure metallicities, and those in the sample of \citet{Engelbracht_2008} 
 were obtained by the direct electron temperature method  \citep{Skillman1998}.
\citet{Mitchel2014} calculated the offset between direct and strong-line measurements for M31 H~{\sc ii} regions to be 
$0.35\pm0.10$ and we correct for this in Figure~\ref{metalicityVseqw}.
The scatter in our sample is large, but the 	
equivalent widths of the 7.7 and 11.3~$\mu$m features are consistent with those of \citet{Engelbracht_2008}. 
No trend with metallicity is seen.
However, we do not have enough data from low-metallicity regions in M31 to observe the expected decrease of EQWs of PAH with the decreasing 
metallicity.  There do seem to be some outliers which can plausibly be due to the uncertainties  and the offset between different methods of calculating the metallicity.  
The M31 region with very low  7.7~$\mu$m  equivalent widths is Region 8, which has
a noisy spectrum in the blue as well as substantial modelled contribution from starlight (see Figure~\ref{PAHFITplots}).
