The final processed IRS spectra are shown in  Figure \ref{PAHFITplots}, except for the nucleus, discussed in Section~\ref{sect:nucleus}.
All of the main PAH features, including the 6.2, 7.7, 8.6 and 11.3~$\mu$m bands, 
are clearly visible for all the regions shown here.
The IRS spectra also show atomic line emission such as [Ar~{\sc ii}], [Ar~{\sc iii}], [S~{\sc iii}], [S~{\sc iv}], [Ne~{\sc ii}], [Ne~{\sc iii}] 
and molecular H$_{2}$ emission at 12.3~$\mu$m. Some of the spectra display a contribution to the continuum from starlight emission.

\subsection{ISOCAM versus IRS}
\label{sect:iso_vs_irs}

As mentioned in the Introduction, based on ISOCAM observations of four regions in M31, \citet{1998Cesarsky} reported 
suppression of the common 6--8~$\mu$m PAH bands and a strong 11.3$\mu$m PAH band.
The 11.3~$\mu$m band profile was found to vary from region to region.  
In addition, \citet{Pagani_1999} confirmed that the star-forming ring in M31 shows very weak PAH emission in the 6 to 8~$\mu$m region. 
However, the IRS spectra presented here do not show such unusual behaviour (Figure~\ref{PAHFITplots}). 
Indeed, all regions show a normal mid-infrared spectrum similar to other nearby starforming galaxies. 

Until 2005, ISOCAM-CVF data were not properly background subtracted and they were contaminated with zodiacal emission and stray light. 
Differential spectra between regions of relatively strong and weak emission were previously used to overcome this problem 
(more details about the differential spectra are given by \citealt{1998Cesarsky}, \citealt{Pagani_1999}). 
In 2005, all ISOCAM-CVF data were reprocessed  and corrected for the zodiacal emission \citep{Boulanger_F_2005}. 
We obtained newly-processed ISOCAM spectra from three regions in our IRS sample (see Section~\ref{sect:iso_data}) 
in order to compare them with the corresponding IRS spectra.
Figure~\ref{ISOnIRS} shows that although the relative feature intensities  in the IRS and ISOCAM 
spectra differ in detail, the spectral shapes are almost identical;
the re-processed ISOCAM data do not agree with the previous differential spectra.
Neither the bulge nor Region 9 shows any depletion in  6 to 8~$\mu$m features as described by \citet{1998Cesarsky}. 
The new ISOCAM reduction appears to eliminate the discrepancies between ISOCAM and IRS, resulting
in less `strange' infrared spectra for M31. For the remainder of this work, we discuss only the IRS spectra.

\subsection{PAHFIT}
\label{sect:pahfit}
The PAH features in  IRS spectra are often blended with neighbouring PAH features and atomic lines. 
Therefore measuring the strength of PAH features is difficult.  To achieve this task a tool called PAHFIT, introduced by \citet{Smith:2007lr}, was used. 
PAHFIT is an IDL  based tool designed for decomposing {\em Spitzer} IRS low-resolution spectra of PAH emission sources.
PAHFIT uses six main components to fit the surface brightness. These are starlight continuum, featureless thermal dust continuum, 
pure rotational lines of H$_2$, fine-structure lines, dust emission features and dust extinction. The starlight is represented by  blackbody 
emission at a fixed temperature of 5000~K, and the dust continuum is represented by 8 modified blackbodies (emissivity proportional to $\nu^2$)  
at fixed temperatures of 35, 40, 50, 65, 90, 135, 200, and 300~K. The final fit obtained with PAHFIT does not necessarily use
all eight dust components.
The infrared extinction is considered as a combination of a power law plus silicate absorption features with peaks at 9.7 and 18~$\mu$m. 
Line features are represented by Gaussian profiles with widths set by the instrumental resolution
and dust features are represented by Drude profiles; more details about PAHFIT are given by \citet{Smith:2007lr}.


Initial attempts at fitting the spectra with PAHFIT showed that some components were negligible, and
to avoid over-fitting we re-ran the fits without these components.
None of the IRS spectra shows significant silicate absorption around 9.7 or 18~$\mu$m, and the extinction calculated by PAHFIT 
was almost zero for all the initial fits. Except for four regions (the bulge, Region 5, Region 6 and Region 8),
the starlight contribution is also negligible.
We adjusted the PAHFIT input parameters to fix extinction to zero for all regions and starlight to zero for all but the four regions above.
Typically only two or three thermal dust components had significant power in our fits, but we did not fix the unused components to zero.
Regions 3 and 9 were found to have very low dust continuum emission compared to other spectra,
possibly because of noisy data at short wavelengths. However the other features in these spectra appear to
be fit correctly.
%SPW:Last sentence of Sec 3.2 also needs to move.
% to be edited once EP has finished 
The spectrum of the nucleus shows silicate emission (see Section~\ref{sect:nucleus}), which is not included in PAHFIT;  
consequently PAHFIT was unable to sucessfully fit the other spectral features in this spectrum.

\subsection{PAH features}
\label{sect:pah}

PAHFIT returns fluxes and equivalent widths (EQWs) of PAH features, which are given in Tables~\ref{PAHlinetable} and \ref{EQW}. 
The intensities of the features do not include any contribution from the continuum, but the equivalent width computed by
\begin{equation}
{\rm EQW}=\int \frac{I_{\nu,{\rm feature}}}{I_{\nu, {\rm cont}}} \,d\lambda,
\end{equation}
is a measure of the ratio of the continuum emission ($I_{\nu, {\rm cont}} $) to the line strength 
($I_{\nu,{\rm feature}}=I_{\nu} =- I_{\nu, {\rm cont}})$. 
The continuum emission is mainly from dust grains, much larger than PAH molecules. Hence, by studying EQWs of PAHs, 
we can study how the PAHs compete with the dust grains in the mid-infrared wavelengths.  PAHFIT returns the EQWs for each PAH 
feature, we calculated the uncertainties using a Monte-Carlo method. In that method, for each region, PAHFIT was run 500 times on 
randomly generated data points  normally distributed within the uncertainties of the spectrum. PAHFIT returned 500 EQWs for each 
PAH feature, and the standard deviation of EQWs for a given feature was taken as its uncertainty. 
The EQWs from Regions 3 and 9 were removed from further analysis because the negligible dust continuum for these spectra makes
the EQWs highly uncertain.


\subsection{Atomic line features}

}
\label{SvsNe}
\end{figure}

PAHFIT also returns the line strengths and uncertainties for atomic lines, listed in Table~\ref{Atomic}.
Not all lines were detected by PAHFIT, so we calculated upper limits for non-detected lines.%
\footnote{To find  the upper limits for the flux of missing atomic lines, we assumed the line to be a 
Gaussian profile with a FWHM as given by PAHFIT. The peak intensity was taken to be 3 times the RMS, where RMS is the root mean square of 
the noise at the position of a missing line.}
Line ratios of [Ne~{\sc iii}]/[Ne~{\sc ii}] and [S~{\sc iv}]/[S~{\sc iii}]~18 have been used as an indication of the radiation hardness, and
\citet{Engelbracht_2008} defined a combination of these two line ratios as a 'radiation hardness index (RHI)':
%
\begin{equation}
{\rm RHI} = \left( \log\frac{\textrm{[Ne~{\sc iii}] }}{\textrm{[Ne~{\sc ii}]}} + \left[0.71 + 1.58\log\frac{\textrm{{[S~{\sc iv}]}}}{\textrm{{[S~{\sc iii}]}}}\right]\right) /2
\end{equation}
\label{eq:rhi}
%
Here, 1.58 and 0.71 are the slope and intercept of the [Ne~{\sc iii}]/[Ne~{\sc ii}]  vs [S~{\sc iv}]/[S~{\sc iii}] plot (Figure \ref{SvsNe}) for the starburst sample from 
\citet{Engelbracht_2008}. The RHI has also been used by \citet{Gordon:2008lr} for M101 observations. 
Figure \ref{SvsNe}  compares the atomic line emission from the selected regions of M31 to the starburst galaxy sample;
although none of our spectra have detections of all four lines, our limits are consistent with the trend.
We therefore compute the RHI using the first term of equation~\ref{eq:rhi} for the regions with missing S lines
and the second term for the regions with missing Ne lines.
Regions 2, 5, and 8 had detections of only one line per element, so we used the appropriate upper limits 
to calculate RHI for these spectra.

{ $^a$Units are 10$^{-10}$~W~m$^{-2}$. Upper limits ($\3sigma$) are indicated with a $<$ mark.  }
%SPW: Table 4: units of 10^-10 W m^-2 must be wrong.  I'd expect 10^-15 or so.
%SPW: How many sigma are the upper limits?
