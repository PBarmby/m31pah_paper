The central region of the Andromeda Galaxy is a complicated place, containing
a massive but quiescent black hole, a multi-component nucleus, young stars, cold gas, and ionized gas 
among other ingredients. While this region has been extensively studied at radio,
optical and X-ray wavelengths, it has received relatively little attention 
in the mid-infrared. Mid-infrared observations might be expected to constrain
the dust properties of the nucleus and surrounding region. As part of a larger project to 
study the properties of PAH emission in M31, we obtained Spitzer low-resolution spectroscopy 
of a 30x50 arcsec (114 x 190 pc) region containing the nucleus. We detect weak 10 micron silicate
emission from an (unresolved?) source at the center of the galaxy as well as
11.3 micron emission, but not other PAH features, from a region about 15 arcsec
to the north. We discuss these spectral features in comparison with those of 
other nearby low-luminosity AGN and the properties of the M31 supermassive black hole.
