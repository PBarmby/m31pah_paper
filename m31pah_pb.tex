\section{Introduction}

% MLNA comments, move to correct locations
%Title: rather generic.  Can you instead say something specific about what characteristics you're describing?  Maybe mention PAHs and silicate emission?
%
%Abstract: 
%
%We present observations of the mid-IR spectra obtained from Spitzer-IRS, covering the wavelength range from 5 to 21 microns towards 12 regions in M31 
%
%-->  We present {\sl Spitzer}/Infrared Spectrograph 5--21\,$\mu$m spectra towards 12 regions in M31
%
%acronym ISOCAM not defined at first use
%
%ISOCAM spectro-imaging observations of M31 showed unusual PAH feature ratios; however, the spectra that we obtained show PAH emission between 6 - 8 microns disagreeing with the previous results from ISOCAM observations.
%
%--> Our spectra reveal PAH emission between 6 and 8 microns that is inconsistent with earlier ISO/ISOCAM observations by [REF HERE] that showed unusual PAH feature ratios.
%
%important: Later on you refer to a re-reduction of the ISOCAM data.  If that's already out there, and it refutes Cesarsky et al, then there's really no need to refer to that paper as a result that we need to confront...somebody else already did it.  In which case, the motivational part of the paper ought not to present Cesarsky et al as something that's still current.
%
%A few trivial points: e.g., and i.e., should be followed by commas in American English (e.g., the ApJ).  Elements of a paper should always be capitalized (Section, Table, Figure).  The text should be consistent about mid-IR vs mid-infrared and other such constructions.  Throughout there is a missing space after arcsec units.  Re-examine places where the word "values" appears, because it is usually not needed:  EQW values --> EQWs, flux values --> fluxes, metallicity values --> metallicities, for example.
%Table 1 would be better if it included the galactocentric radii (perhaps), and the UV intensities, metallicities, and dust temperatures (definitely) used to choose them as targets in the first place.  Also which fields were previously observed by ISO/ISOCAM.  Suggested new title: Spitzer/IRS Target Locations in M31.
%
%Table 2 should make explicit that the fluxes given are prior to color-correction
%
%How was the line of best fit derived -- did you weight by uncertainty?
%
%Can you cite others who applied *offsets* to force IRS spectra to match up, as opposed to using only multiplicative factors -- is this standard practice?
%
%The title of Sec 3 should be more specific; data analysis sounds akin to data reduction.  Sec 3 (text) needs to be much clearer as to which spectra (IRS or ISO) are being discussed.
%
%Sec 3.1, para 1, 1st sentence needs a reference, like maybe an ISO user's guide or some kind of technical memo.
%
%I suppose others may know what a Drude profile is, but this is the first I've heard of it
%
%Sec 3.2, last para.  Why do you hard-wire these parameters to exclude them entirely, if there is *some* contribution seen from them in the spectra?
%
%Do you need to number the equation in Sec 3.3, para 1.  Also, it is unclear from the text why you write it this way instead of just putting I(nu)_feature in the numerator and then having to explain your notation in the text
%
%Does PAHFIT *separately* fit an independent Gaussian to each of the atomic lines in Sec 3.4?  They are not correlated in any way?
%
%Figures 8 and 9 are really just the same figure, spread over two pages.  Is there any benefit to showing the fit residuals in each case?  The fits looks quite good BTW
%
%Table 5 has names inconsistent with other tables in the paper
%
%Fig 12 caption -- what is meant by "dividing each EQW by their weighted average over all regions."  -- why do you normalize in this way?
%
%Sec 4.3 -- I see the North region, but where is the South East one -- can it be indicated in Fig 14 somehow,  to distinguish from the noise at the edge of the mosaic?
