% If your system does not have the AMS fonts version 2.0 installed, then
% remove the useAMS option.
%
% useAMS allows you to obtain upright Greek characters.
% e.g. \umu, \upi etc.  See the section on "Upright Greek characters" in
% this guide for further information.
%
% If you are using AMS 2.0 fonts, bold math letters/symbols are available
% at a larger range of sizes for NFSS release 1 and 2 (using \boldmath or
% preferably \bmath).
%
% The usenatbib command allows the use of Patrick Daly's natbib.sty for
% cross-referencing.
%
% If you wish to typeset the paper in Times font (if you do not have the
% PostScript Type 1 Computer Modern fonts you will need to do this to get
% smoother fonts in a PDF file) then uncomment the next line
