%Title: rather generic.  Can you instead say something specific about what characteristics you're describing?  Maybe mention PAHs and silicate emission?

% MLNA comments
%A few trivial points: e.g., and i.e., should be followed by commas in American English (e.g., the ApJ).  Elements of a paper should always be capitalized (Section, Table, Figure).  The text should be consistent about mid-IR vs mid-infrared and other such constructions.  Throughout there is a missing space after arcsec units.  Re-examine places where the word "values" appears, because it is usually not needed:  EQW values --> EQWs, flux values --> fluxes, metallicity values --> metallicities, for example.
