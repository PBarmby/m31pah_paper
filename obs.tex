We obtained mid-infrared spectral maps of 12 regions in M31 using the {\em Spitzer}/IRS instrument \citep{IRS2004} covering wavelengths from 5 to 21 microns. 
These regions include the nucleus, two regions previously observed by ISOCAM, and 9 other regions chosen to cover a range of UV intensities, 
metallicities and dust temperatures. Dust temperatures were determined using an $8 - 24/70 - 160$ $\mu$m colour-colour diagram 
(see Figure~\ref{colourmaps}). The locations of the observed regions are shown in Figure~\ref{m31}, and 
their coordinates are given in Table~\ref{regions}. The two regions previously observed by ISOCAM are the region from the bulge and the 
region from the active region in the star-forming ring (Region 9 in our sample). A background observation was also made off the galaxy 
along the minor axis and it was used to enable the background subtraction from the data cubes.

For our observations we used the Short-Low (SL) and Long-Low (LL) modules which cover wavelengths from 5 to 21 microns. 
The Low modules have resolving power changing 60--130. Each low-resolution module is divided into two sub-slits 
which provide spectroscopy in either first or second order. They are denoted as SL1 (7.5--14.5~$\mu$m), SL2 (5.2--7.6~$\mu$m),
LL1 (20.5--38.5~$\mu$m), and LL2 (14.5--20.75~$\mu$m).

All regions were observed in September 2007 (PID 40032) with both orders of the Short-Low module (SL2, SL1) and the Long-Low order LL2. 
The Long-Low order LL1 was not used for observations because this spectral region contains few features. The map size was based on the size 
of the IRS slits (SL: $3.6\arcsec \times 57\arcsec$, LL: $10.5\arcsec \times 168\arcsec$). Each region was covered by 18 overlapping observations 
of the SL slit and 11 overlapping observations of the LL slit making the map size $32\arcsec \times 57\arcsec$ for SL and $58\arcsec \times 168\arcsec$ for LL. 
Figure~\ref{slits} shows an example of the slit arrangement. For the brighter regions (nucleus, bulge), ramp times of 14 s (SL) and 30 s (LL) were used, 
while for the fainter regions, ramp times of 60 and 120 s were used respectively. Background observations were taken with each module (2 per ramp time). 
Since all of the targets are in the same part of the sky, a common background observation was used for multiple targets to subtract the background emission.

\subsection{IRS Data Reduction}

The data were reduced through the SSC pipeline (ver. S17.2.0) and the maps were assembled using the CUBISM program \citep{Smith:2007fk}. 
Bad pixel removal was also done using CUBISM and the background observations were used to subtract the background emission from these cubes 
following the method outlined in \citet{Gordon:2008lr}. Spectra were extracted using a $30\arcsec\times50\arcsec$   rectangular aperture. 
The aperture size was selected to cover the whole overlapping area of the SL and LL modes.

After the spectral extraction there was a noticeable mismatch between the spectra from the SL1 and LL2 modules. To combine all spectra to obtain one spectrum, 
first a photometric comparison was conducted between the IRS spectra and the IRAC 8 micron image of M31 \citep{Barmby2006lr}. For more details 
about this method see the IRAC Instrument Handbook Section 4. An aperture with the same size was used to extract flux from the same regions 
in the IRAC 8 micron image. The photometric calibration of the IRAC is tied to point sources measured within a standard aperture with a radius of 12\arcsec. 
For extended sources,  an aperture correction has to be conducted as mentioned in the IRAC instrument handbook. Therefore an extended source 
aperture correction of 0.824 was applied for all the extractions from the 8 $\mu$m image. The uncertainty value of the IRAC image was estimated 
by taking the standard deviation of pixels values within an aperture of the same size from a position off M31 (00:48:58.00, +42:14:54.00).

Then we stitched the SL1 and SL2 using the overlapping regions and applied a colour correction factor $K$, which is a multiplicative factor that 
converts the intensity of an IRS spectrum at a given wavelength to the intensity of an IRAC image taken at the same wavelength. We used the IDL 
code provided by the instrument handbook to compute these $K$ values for all the regions. colour correction values and the corresponding IRS 
data along with the IRAC data are given in Table~\ref{colourK}.

Figure~\ref{offset} compares the IRS and IRAC 8~$\mu$m photometry. The line of best fit wighted by the uncertainties has a slope of $0.81\pm0.08$ 
and intercept of $-0.05\pm0.06$.  Since the intercept in Figure~\ref{offset} is not zero with a higher uncertainty, it can be concluded that the offsets 
between orders are due to an additive offset than a multiplicative offset. Also an additive offset favours more for stitching SL and LL modes. 
Based on this argument, first we shifted the combined SL1 and SL2 spectrum so that the intensity at 8 $\mu$m matches with that of IRAC 8 micron image. 
To do this shift, the following equation was used to find the offset values ($x$) between IRS and IRAC image intensities at 8 microns. 
\begin{equation}
F_{IRAC8} = [ F_{IRS8} + x ] \times K
%K is the colour correction factor.
\end{equation}
\footnotesize
%\emph{Where K is the colour correction factor, Flux$_{IRAC8}$ is the flux of the IRAC 8 $\mu$m image, Flux$_{IRS8}$ is the flux of IRS spectra at 8 $\mu$m and x is the offset.}
\normalsize
$K$ is the colour correction factor, F$_{IRAC8}$ is the intensity of the IRAC 8 $\mu$m image (aperture corrected) and F$_{IRS8}$ is the intensity of IRS spectra at 8~$\mu$m. 
The offsets for all the regions are listed in Table \ref{colourK}. After that the LL2 mode was stitched by shifting it towards the SL1 by an amount of the average difference in their overlapping spectral regions.

\subsection{ISOCAM Data Reduction}


To compare our results with previous observations, ISOCAM data of three regions previously observed by \citet{1998Cesarsky} which overlap 
with IRS observations were obtained. We retrieved the highly processed data provided by \citet{Boulanger_F_2005} of these ISOCAM observations. 
The total wavelength range covered was 5.15 to 16.5 $\mu$m and the field-of-view was $32\times 32$ pixels with 6\arcsec\ per pixel. 
An image of the ISOCAM data is shown in Figure~\ref{isonuc}.  For the three regions in common, we extracted spectra using the same aperture as for the IRS data.
